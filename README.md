This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## The test
Here at Viaplay we're very fond of Pokemons and we want to start our very own Pokedex.

To do so, we will rely on the always usefull `PokeApi`.

You should connect to [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) and fetch some pokemons (the number is up to you) and render the name in a list.

Any further thing you'll implement will sum more points to your evaluation ⭐️

Good luck and good PokeHunting.
